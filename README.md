# Where am I again?

A Dalamud plugin to display your current location on screen at all times in plain text.

## What's it do?

It displays text next to the server info that says where you are on the map.  Currently this displays `Your Territory, Your Region`, e.g. `Old Sharlayan, The Northern Empty`.

## Todos

- Allow hiding the region by config
- Filter toasts to just zone names somehow so we can grab the more granular area
- More configuration and customization
